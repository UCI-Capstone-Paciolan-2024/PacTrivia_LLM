      "A member of the Western Athletic Conference, Abilene Christian sponsors teams in seven men's and eight women's NCAA sanctioned sports.On December 6, 1923, Abilene Christian applied for admission to Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association during the conference annual meeting in Dallas.The Wildcats had been considering joining the conference for several years but funding for the athletic department preventing them to join the conference sooner.On July 1, 2013, Abilene Christian returned to the Southland Conference as one of four new members.The university, a charter member of the Southland Conference, left the Southland in 1973 to join the Lone Star Conference (LSC) of NCAA Division II.The Wildcats remained members of the Lone Star Conference from 1973 until returning to the Southland Conference in 2013.Overall, the Wildcats have won a combined 62 team national championships, including 57 as a member of the NCAA trailing behind UCLA, Stanford, USC and Kenyon College for the most NCAA team championships.In 2007, the LSC included 33 ACU current and former student athletes in its 75-member all-sports team commemorating the conference's 75th anniversary.On August 23, 2017, the NCAA Board of Directors voted to pass ACU through to full Division I status, thus making them eligible for postseason play.On January 14, 2021, ACU was one of five institutions announced as future members of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), alongside three other Southland members from Texas (Lamar, Sam Houston, Stephen F.Austin) plus Big Sky Conference member Southern Utah.Initially, all five schools were to join in July 2022, but the entry of ACU and the other Texas schools was moved to 2021 after the Southland expelled its departing members.ACU football competed in a football-only partnership between the WAC and the ASUN Conference in the 2021 and 2022 seasons.After the 2022 season, the conferences fully merged their football leagues, creating what eventually became the United Athletic Conference.=== Conference affiliation history ===\n",
